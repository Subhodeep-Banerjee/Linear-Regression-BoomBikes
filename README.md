## General Information

The US-based bike-sharing company, Boom Bikes, is grappling with significant revenue declines amid the ongoing pandemic. Adapting to the challenging market conditions, the company is strategizing to boost revenue post-lockdown, aligning with the economic recovery. With a focused business plan, they aim to navigate these difficulties, ensuring sustainability and growth once normalcy is restored.

## Conclusions

1) Seasonal Expansion: Business expansion efforts should be concentrated during the spring season. Spring appears to be a promising period for        attracting more users.
2) September Surge: September emerges as another significant month for business growth. Strategic initiatives and promotions during this month could yield substantial returns.
3) Post-Crisis Anticipation: Anticipate a surge in user numbers once the situation normalizes, especially when compared to the data from 2019. Preparedness for increased demand post-crisis is crucial.
4) Optimizing Low Business Periods: During light snow or rain, when bookings are expected to be lower, the company can utilize this time to conduct bike servicing activities without significant impacts on business.

In summary, the company should devise attractive offers during the pleasant spring months and consider targeted advertising for the month of September, which is anticipated to be a peak period for the business after the crisis subsides.
